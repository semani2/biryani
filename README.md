## Mise en place

### Marination (T - 12 hours)
1. Cut the carrots, potatoes, zucchini and bell pepper into 1 inch pieces and add to a mixing bowl.

5. Slice the 3 green thai chilli and add it to the mixing bowl.
6. Add the soy chunks to 1 cup of water and place them in a microwave safe bowl and heat for 2-3 mins. Once done, strain the soy chunks and add them to the mixing bowl.
7. Add 3 tbsp of fired onions to the mixing bowl.
8. Next, add the 1/2 cup of yogurt to the mixing bowl and finally, 1 tbsp of ghee.
9. Now that we have all the required ingredients in the mixing bowl, mix all the ingredients together ensuring all veggies and panner are coated well with the mixture of yogurt and the spices.
10. Place marinated bowl of ingredients in the refrigerator over night or for at least 6 hours. 

### Preparing the rice (T - 2 hours)
1. Wash the basmati rice multiple times to remove all starch. 
2. Soak rice in water for at least 45 mins to 1 hour.

### Preparing other ingredients (T - 90 mins)
1. Finely chop mint and coriander leaves and store them together in a dry bowl.
2. Slightly warm 1/4 cup milk in a bowl, add the saffron strands to the warm milk and keep aside.

## Let the cooking begin!

### Cook the veggies (T - 1 hour)
1. Take a deep sauce pan or a dutch oven and place it on the stove. Set the flame to medium.
2. Add 2 tbsp of ghee and 1 tsp of cooking oil to the pan.
3. As the oil starts to heat up, add 1 tbsp of ginger & garlic paste.
4. Once the raw flavor of the paste reduces, transfer the marinated vegetables to the sauce pan.
5. Gently stir the contents occasionally as they start to cook. You don't want to stir a lot as it might break up the paneer. 
6. Continue to cook until the vegetables are 75% done, this should usually take around 20 - 25 mins.
7. Once done transfer contents into a different container.

### Cook the rice (T - 30 mins)
1. Take a deep sauce pan (can re-use the one you cooked the veggies in) and place it on the stove. Set the flame to high.
2. Set aside two plates. We will be using these plates to spread the cooked rice and prepare it for layering.
3. Fill half the pan with water.
4. As the water starts to heat up, add salt, all the dry spices, 1 tsp of ghee and 2tbsp of the chopped coriander and mint leaves.
5. Next, as the water starts to boil, strain the soaking rice of all water and add rice to the boiling water in the pan.
6. As the rice boils to about 50% done (rice kernel breaks when pressed with a nail and doesn't smudge), strain and transfer half of the rice to one of the plates we set aside. (Make sure to remember which plate holds the less cooked rice)
7. Strain and transfer the remaining rice when it is about 80% done to the other plate.

### Layering the biryani (T - 0mins)
1. Take a pressure cooker/dutch over/deep sauce pan with lid.
2. Spread evenly about 1 tbsp of Ghee or oil to the bottom of the pan.
3. Add 50% of the cooked vegetables and spread them evenly.
4. On the layer of vegetables, sprinkle about 2 tbsp of fried onions, 2 tbsp of chopped coriander and mint leavers, 1 tbsp of saffron milk.
5. Now, on this layer, evenly spread the 50% cooked rice. 
6. Next, as in step 4, sprinkle about 2 tbsp of fried onions, 2 tbsp of chopped coriander and mint leavers, 1 tbsp of saffron milk on the layer of rice.
7. Now, add the remaining half of the cooked vegetables mixture on the layer of rice and sprinkle about 2 tbsp of fried onions, 2 tbsp of chopped coriander and mint leavers, 1 tbsp of saffron milk.
8. Finally, add the a layer of 80% cooked rice to the layer of cooked vegetables and sprinkle in another 2 tbsp of fried onions, remaining mixture of coriander and mint leaves and the saffron milk.
9. Once that the layering is complete, pour about 2 tsp of ghee along the inner walls of the pan.
10. Now that we have all our layers, it is time to apply the "dum".
11. If you are using a pressure cooker, wet a cotton cloth or napkin, and place it on top of the pressure cooker (if cotton cloth not available, take a few paper towels, make them damp and place on top of the last layer of rice). The same can be done if using a dutch oven or a sauce pan.
12. Once the cotton cloth or the paper towels have been placed, close the pressure cooker / place the lid on the dutch oven/pan.
13. Place the cooker on the stove and set heat to the lowest level possible. If available, place a griddle on the stove and place the cooker on top of that. 
13. Let the biryani "dum" for about 30-40 mins allowing it cook in its own steam, enhancing flavors and taste.
14. Finally, open the "dum" and serve hot biryani!
